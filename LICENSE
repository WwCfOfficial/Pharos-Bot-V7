  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. This license is applied to this program by
WwCfOfficial, the author.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  [Standard GPL v3 terms apply. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html]

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file:

    Pharos-Bot-V7 - A bot for automating tasks in the Pharos ecosystem.
